## ðŸš€ Usage

```bash
command-launcher                         # Runs the default command
command-launcher -sc "echo Hello" -id hi # Saves 'echo Hello' under ID 'hi'
command-launcher -c hi                   # Runs command saved as 'hi'
command-launcher -r hi                   # Removes the command 'hi'
command-launcher -c secure -su           # Runs ID 'secure' with sudo

```
# Discontinued
This Project is officially discontinued honestly I just made it for learn c++ and some fun and this could be easily replaced by .sh files easily I was so dumb not to think about it but at least this does not make a cluster of files to run big commands. Hope you try if you need. There will be no updates or fixes will be released on this project from 12/7/2025
